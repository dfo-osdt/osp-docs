# 9.0 - ORCID

ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a unique, persistent digital identifier (PID) that distinguishes
individual researchers and their work, allowing them to connect their contributions—such as articles, datasets, and
reviews—across organizations, journals, and funding bodies. ORCID offers a streamlined way to accurately track and share
research outputs, ensuring researchers receive proper attribution and recognition for their work, even as they change
institutions or roles.

ORCID simplifies data collection and reporting, enhances collaboration and visibility across projects, and
improves the management of researcher profiles, thereby supporting transparency and continuity in scientific
endeavors.
