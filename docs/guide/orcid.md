# 9.0 - ORCID

[ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)](https://orcid.org/) is a unique, persistent digital identifier (PID) that distinguishes
individual researchers and their work, allowing them to connect their contributions—such as articles, datasets, and
reviews—across organizations, journals, and funding bodies. ORCID provides a streamlined way to accurately track and share
research outputs, ensuring researchers receive proper attribution and recognition for their work, even as they change
institutions or roles.

ORCID simplifies data collection and reporting, enhances collaboration and visibility across projects, and
improves the management of researcher profiles, thereby supporting transparency and continuity in scientific
endeavors.

## 9.3 - Authorize Access

![Authorize](/images/orcid_authorize.png)

To enhance your experience with ORCID through the OSP, we encourage you to authorize the OSP to update your ORCID
profile on your behalf. This authorization allows the OSP to automatically add relevant attributes, such as your
affiliations, areas of expertise, and research contributions, directly to your ORCID profile—saving you time and
ensuring accuracy. Additionally, managing your employment records through the OSP enables an official DFO source badge
to appear on your ORCID profile, providing visible, verified credentials that bolster your professional presence.

## 9.4 - Manage Employment Records

Managing your employment records through the OSP allows you to update your ORCID profile with official employment information from DFO. By linking your DFO employment, you enhance the credibility of your profile, making it more visible and trusted within the scientific community.
