# 6.0 - Advanced Features

## 6.1 - Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier

### 6.1.1 - About

The Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID) is a unique identifier
that distinguishes individual researchers and their body of work. Much like how
a passport uniquely identifies a traveler, ORCID provides a persistent digital
identifier that follows researchers throughout their careers, regardless of
changes in name, affiliation, or research field.

ORCID, Inc. is an independent nonprofit organization incorporated in Delaware,
United States of America. ORCID began issuing identifiers in October 2012. ORCID
has over 1,300 member organizations including Caltech, Cornell University,
Springer, Wiley, Thomson Reuters, and the Australian Research Council.
