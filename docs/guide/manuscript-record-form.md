##### Generate a Plain Language Summary

You can choose to have a Plain Language Summary generated for you based on
your abstract. This tool runs locally within the DFO network, meaning that any information sent to this tool
**will not leave the DFO intranet**.

This tool works by using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model
(LLM) developed by [Meta, called Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com/). Llama 3.2 is designed for use in a closed network
environment and therefore **cannot send any information to Meta or outside the DFO intranet**.

When using any AI tool while connected to a Government of Canada network, it is good practice to familiarize yourself with the
[Treasury Board of Canada
Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html)
rules and guidelines on the use of Artificial Intelligence Language Models.

:::warning
Please verify the Generated Plain Language Summary for accuracy!
