# 1.0 - Introduction

## 1.1 - Welcome
Welcome to the Open Science Portal (OSP) User Guide and Documentation Site! This user
guide and documentation site have been developed by the Collaborative for Open
Science (COSI) for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

## 1.2 - Purpose
The purpose of this documentation site is to explain the navigation, usage, and
troubleshooting of the OSP. This documentation site is dynamic and will be
continuously updated to reflect changes in the OSP.

## 1.3 - Audience
The User Guide is designed to be used by:
- DFO Researchers
- Research Assistants
- Division Managers
- Regional Directors of Science (RDS)

## 1.4 - Guide Production Assumptions
This guide is produced with the assumption that you are navigating the OSP with
a traditional mouse and keyboard. The majority of the action buttons found
within the OSP are executed using a left-mouse-button click. Therefore, this
guide has reduced the term "left-click" to "click". The documentation will state
if any other method of action is required.

## 1.5 - Feedback
Any feedback, questions, or concerns about the OSP or the User Guide can be
emailed to [DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).
