# 1.0 - Introduction

## 1.1 - Welcome
Welcome to the Open Science Portal User Guide and Documentation Site! This user guide and documentation site have been developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada for use by private individuals and public servants.

## 1.2 - Purpose
The purpose of this documentation site is to explain the navigation, usage, and troubleshooting of the Open Science Portal. This documentation site is dynamic and will be continuously updated to reflect changes in the Open Science Portal.

## 1.3 - Audience
The User Guide is designed to be used by:
- Fisheries and Oceans Canada Researchers
- Non-Fisheries and Oceans Canada Researchers
- Research Assistants
- Division Managers
- Regional Directors of Science

## 1.4 - Guide Production Assumptions
This guide is produced with the assumption that you are navigating the Open Science Portal with a traditional mouse and keyboard. The majority of the action buttons found within the Open Science Portal are executed using a left-mouse-button click. Therefore, this guide has reduced the term "left-click" to "click". The documentation will state if any other method of action is required.

## 1.5 - Feedback
Any feedback, questions, or concerns about the Open Science Portal or the User Guide can be emailed to [DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).
