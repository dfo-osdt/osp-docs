## Purpose

The Open Science Portal (OSP) was developed to digitize the Manuscript Record Form (MRF) creation, review, and management process. The OSP adheres to the [National Policy for Science Publications](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/policy-politique/index-eng.html) and supports DFO's commitment to Open Science.

Additional features of the OSP include storage and sharing of MRFs, publication status tracking, author expertise profiles, and ORCID integration.
