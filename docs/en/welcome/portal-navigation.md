## Purpose

The Open Science Portal (OSP) was developed to digitize the Manuscript Record
Form (MRF) creation, review, and management process. The OSP was designed to adhere to
the [National Policy for Science
Publications](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/policy-politique/index-eng.html)
and promote DFO's commitment to Open Science.

Additonal features of the OSP include storage and sharing of MRF's, Publication
status tracking, author expertise profiles, and ORCID integration.
