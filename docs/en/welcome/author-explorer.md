# Author Explorer

![Explore Authors](/images/welcome/explore_authors.png)

You can explore all authors who have created an account with the OSP or have been added as authors to a manuscript. By exploring an author, you can find a link to their organization's ROR page, their email address, and their ORCID (if available).

You can filter authors using the Authors Filter Menu located on the left side of the page. The available filters are:
- All Authors
- Internal Authors
- External Authors
- With ORCID
