# Introduction

## Welcome

Welcome to the Open Science Portal (OSP) User Guide and Documentation Site! This guide has been developed by the Collaborative for Open Science (COSI) for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

## Purpose

## Audience

The User Guide is designed for:
- DFO Researchers
- Research Assistants
- Division Managers
- Regional Directors of Science (RDS)

## Guide Production Assumptions

This guide assumes you are navigating the OSP with a traditional mouse and keyboard. The majority of action buttons within the OSP are executed using a left-mouse-button click. Therefore, the term "left-click" is shortened to just "click." Any actions requiring a different method will be explicitly stated.

## Feedback

Any feedback, questions, or concerns about the OSP or the User Guide can be emailed to [DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).
