# Management Review Process

## My Management Reviews Page

You can check the status of manuscripts you have reviewed or have been selected to review on the **My Management Reviews** page.

To access the **My Management Reviews** page:

1. Expand the page selection menu by hovering your mouse over the left-sidebar menu.
2. Select **My Management Reviews**.

::: note
In cases where the review involves revisions to the manuscript, you may notice
that the same manuscript appears for each step of that review. This is because
each step has its own tracked review outcome.
:::

On the **My Management Reviews** page, you will see a list of all manuscripts awaiting your review. Click on a pending Manuscript Record Form (MRF) to begin reviewing it.

## Reviewing an MRF

### Your role as the reviewing manager
Reviews the manuscript for compliance with the [Intellectual Property Policy/Copyright Act](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/terms-avis/copyright-droits-eng.htm), the [Privacy Act](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-privacy-act/pa_brief/), the Financial Administration Act (with respect to approvals of publication costs) and the [Values and Ethics Code for DFO](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/vicr-virc/vicr-virc2012-eng.htm).

Identifies when a manuscript is of potential public interest for the sole purpose of informing RDS and DFO regional Communications. Examples of topics of potential public interest could include subjects related to current events, or of stakeholder interest. These can include interesting stories to show case DFO research or studies that are more controversial. The inclusion of potentially sensitive material will never prevent the publication of a manuscript in any way.

Authors may submit their publication to the third-party journal for peer review after the manager has deemed the publication to be in alignment with the relevant legislation, policies and directives, or if no feedback was received from the management review within 10 working days. Division Managers, National Directors, Regional Directors of Science and National Directors General may perform the management review.

For more information please refer to the [Fisheries and Oceans Canada National Policy for Science Publications](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/policy-politique/index-eng.html).

### 10-working-day timeline

For convenience, the portal calculates the 10-working-day timeline where applicable. However, the portal does not automatically review MRFs past this time and managers are still expected to complete the review regardless of whether the paper was submitted.

::: tabs

@tab Third-Party Publications and Preprints

If a manager identifies issues related to the relevant legislation, policies, and directives, they must communicate with the author(s) to request revisions or refer the publication to the respective Regional Director of Science or National Director General, and the 10-working-day timeline is paused.

Example of paused timeline:

- A division manager sends the manuscript to an RDS or DG.
- A manager asks the author for revisions based on their review. In this case, the 10-working-day timeline restarts when the author replies.

@tab DFO Publications

There is no 10-working-day timeline for DFO publications. As per the policy, managers are to reply in a timely manner.
