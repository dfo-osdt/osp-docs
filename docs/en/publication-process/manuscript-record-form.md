## Navigating the MRF Form

![MRF Form Navigation](/images/publication-process/mrf_overview.png)

The Manuscript Record Form (MRF) is organized into several sections, each accessible from the left-side navigation menu. As you work through the form, you can move between sections by clicking the corresponding menu items. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*), and you must complete all required fields before submitting the form for review.

Key navigation features include:

- **Section Menu:** Use the left sidebar to quickly jump to different sections, such as General Information, Authors, Peer Reviewers, and Funding Sources.
- **Progress Indicators:** Sections with incomplete required fields are highlighted, helping you track your progress.
- **Save Options:** You can save your progress at any time by clicking the circular **Floppy-Disk** button at the bottom-right or the **Save** button at the bottom of the form.
- **Form Status:** The top-right corner displays the current status of your manuscript (e.g., Draft, In Review).

Navigating the form efficiently ensures that all necessary information is provided and helps streamline the submission process.

### Section Menu

1. **Form**: This is the primary page of the MRF. It contains the form and submission system.
2. **Management Review**: This [page](./management-review-process.md) shows the current status of the management review of the MRF.
3. **Manuscript Progress**: This [page](./manuscript-record-form.md#manuscript-progress) shows the workflow and current progress of this MRF.
4. **Sharing**: This [page](./manuscript-record-form.md#sharing-a-mrf) allows you to share the MRF with others. Note that authors and all management review users will have access to the MRF and do not need to be added here.
5. **Publication**: This takes you to the associated [publication](./publications.md) if it exists. The publication will be created once you flag that your manuscript was accepted for publication.

## Populating an MRF

![New MRF](/images/publication-process/new_mrf.png)

[Plain Language Summaries](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/communications-community-office/communications-101-boot-camp-canadian-public-servants/plain-language-accessibility-inclusive-communications.html) are required for all scientific publications to improve accessibility.

The plain language summary of your manuscript should be written for an 8th-grade reading level to ensure broader
comprehension.

##### Source Language of the PLS

Select whether you want to provide a PLS in either English or French. You may choose to provide it
in both languages but only the language you choose here is required to submit for a management review.

##### Generate a Plain Language Summary Draft

You can generate a draft Plain Language Summary (PLS) based on your abstract and the chosen language. This tool operates locally within the DFO network, ensuring that any information sent to it **does not leave the DFO intranet**.

::: note
The tool utilizes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM) called [Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com/), developed by Meta. Llama 3.2 is specifically designed for use in a closed network environment and therefore **cannot transmit any information to Meta or outside the DFO intranet**.

When using AI tools within a Government of Canada network, it is recommended that you review the [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html) on the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence Language Models.
:::

:::tip
The **Generate PLS** feature helps create a draft based on your uploaded manuscript. You can generate a PLS multiple times to refine your draft. Once you're satisfied with the PLS, you can use the **Translate PLS** feature to translate it in the other official language.
:::

After adding the Plain Language Summary, save your changes by either:

- Clicking the **Floppy-Disk icon** at the bottom-right of the page, or
- Scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking the **Save** button.

##### Author Approval

Once the PLS is complete, the author must confirm that they have reviewed and

have reviewed the PLS prior to checking this confirmation. All authors have
access to their own MRF by logging-in to the portal.
