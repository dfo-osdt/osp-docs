description: Overview of publication types and workflows in the Open Science Portal
---

The Open Science Portal supports two main types of publications, each with their own workflow and requirements. This section will help you understand which type applies to your situation and guide you through the appropriate process.

## Publication Types

### DFO Publications

**DFO Publications** are manuscripts that will be published directly by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. These include:

- DFO Technical Reports
- DFO Research Documents
- DFO Advisory Documents
- Other official DFO publications

**When to use this workflow:**

- Your manuscript will be published through DFO's official publication channels
- DFO is the primary publisher
- The work was conducted primarily within DFO or under DFO funding

### Third-Party Publications

**Third-Party Publications** are manuscripts that will be published by external publishers such as:

- Peer-reviewed journals
- Conference proceedings
- Book chapters
- Other non-DFO publications

**When to use this workflow:**

- Your manuscript will be submitted to an external journal or publisher
- DFO is not the publisher, but DFO authors or resources are involved
- The work involves DFO researchers but will be published elsewhere

## Common Workflow Steps

Both publication types share several common steps:

1. **Manuscript Record Creation** - Create and populate the manuscript record form
2. **Management Review Process** - Submit for review by appropriate managers
3. **Publication Management** - Track and manage the publication once approved

## Need Help Deciding?

If you're unsure which publication type applies to your manuscript:

1. Consider who will be the publisher of the final work
2. Review the specific requirements in each section
3. Contact the [Open Science Portal Support Team](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) for guidance
