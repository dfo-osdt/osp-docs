The Open Science Portal supports two main types of publications, each with its own process and requirements. This section will help you understand which type applies to your situation and guide you through the appropriate process.

## Types of Publications

### DFO Publications

**DFO publications** are manuscripts that will be published directly by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. These include:

- DFO Technical Reports
- DFO Research Documents
- DFO Advisory Documents
- Other official DFO publications

**When to use this process:**

- Your manuscript will be published through official DFO publication channels
- DFO is the primary publisher
- The work was conducted primarily within DFO or funded by DFO

[→ Get started with the DFO Manuscript Record Form](/en/publication-process/manuscript-record-form.md)

### Third-Party Journal Publications

**third-party journal publications** are manuscripts that will be published by external publishers such as:

- Peer-reviewed journals
- Conference proceedings
- Book chapters
- Other non-DFO publications

**When to use this process:**

- Your manuscript will be submitted to an external journal or publisher
- DFO is not the publisher, but DFO authors or resources are involved
- The work involves DFO researchers but will be published elsewhere

[→ Get started with the Third-Party Manuscript Record Form](/en/publication-process/manuscript-record-form.md)

### Preprints

**Preprints** are scientific or technical documents intended to be shared via a preprint server before, or independently of, formal peer-reviewed publication in a journal, book, or conference proceedings.

**When to use this process:**

- You intend to post a manuscript on a preprint server to gather feedback.

## Common Process Steps

All publication types share several common steps:

1. **Manuscript Record Creation** – Create and complete the Manuscript Record Form
2. **Manuscript Management Review Process** – Submit for manuscript management review by the appropriate managers
3. **Publication Management** – Track and manage the publication once approved

## Need Help Deciding?

If you are unsure which publication type applies to your manuscript:

1. Consider who will be the publisher of the final work
2. Review the specific requirements in each section
3. Contact the [Open Science Portal support team](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) for guidance
