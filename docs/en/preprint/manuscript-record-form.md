# Preprint Manuscript Record Form

## My Manuscripts Page

Authors can access the manuscript record page in multiple ways. This walkthrough covers one of those methods:

1. Expand the page selection menu by hovering your mouse over the left-sidebar menu.
2. Click **My Manuscripts**.

On the **My Manuscripts** page, you will see a list of all manuscript records you have created or that have been shared with you. This list includes manuscripts that are in progress.

## Create a New MRF

To create a new Manuscript Record Form for a preprint:

1. Click **Create New MRF**.
2. Select **Preprint** as the publication type.
3. Complete the required fields in the form.

When creating a preprint MRF, you'll need to provide manuscript details, author information, preprint server information, and research classification details.

## Editing Your MRF

You can edit your manuscript record form at any time before final submission by navigating to **My Manuscripts**, clicking on the manuscript you want to edit, and selecting **Edit MRF**.

## Sharing and Collaboration

You can share your MRF with collaborators by opening your manuscript record, clicking **Share**, entering collaborator email addresses, and setting appropriate permission levels.

## Review Status Tracking

Your MRF will show the current status as it progresses through the review process, from draft to published preprint.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance with your MRF, access help documentation, contact support, watch video tutorials, or check the FAQ section.
