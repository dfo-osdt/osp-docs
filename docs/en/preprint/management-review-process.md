## Review an MRF

When reviewing an MRF, you will see the information the author has provided about their manuscript. This includes:

- **Title and Abstract**: Review the manuscript title and abstract for accuracy and completeness
- **Author Information**: Verify author details and affiliations
- **Publication Details**: Check preprint server information and submission status
