# Portal Navigation

## Purpose

The Open Science Portal (OSP) aims to enhance Fisheries and Oceans Canada's
(DFO) scientific knowledge mobilization by adhering to Canada's Roadmap for Open
Science. The primary objective is to create an adaptable portal that simplifies
the publication process, ensures research traceability, promotes open
communication, and fosters collaboration. This portal empowers DFO science staff
by providing a platform to track, discover, and promote scientific research and
expertise within the department.

Additional features of the OSP include storage and sharing of Manuscript Record
Forms (MRFs), publication status tracking, author expertise profiles, and ORCID
integration.
