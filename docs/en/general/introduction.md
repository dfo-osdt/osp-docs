## Welcome

Welcome to the Open Science Portal (OSP) User Guide and Documentation Site! This guide has been developed by the Collaborative for Open Science (COSI) for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation site is to explain the navigation, usage, and troubleshooting of the OSP. This site is dynamic and will be continuously updated to reflect changes in the OSP.

## Guide Structure

This comprehensive user guide is organized into logical sections to help you navigate the OSP efficiently:

**Getting Started** - Introduction and initial setup
**Portal Features** - Learn to navigate the portal and use key features
**The Publishing Process** - Complete workflows for both DFO and third-party publications
**Support & Resources** - Troubleshooting, contact information, and additional resources

## Quick Start

New to the OSP? Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) to set up your account and learn the basics.

Need to create and submit a manuscript for management review? Go to [Manuscript Overview](../publication-process/manuscript-overview.md) to determine which type of publication workflow you need.

## Audience

The User Guide is designed for:

- DFO Researchers
- Research Assistants
- Division Managers
- Regional Directors of Science (RDS)
- Director and Director General

## Guide Production Assumptions

This guide assumes you are navigating the OSP with a traditional mouse and keyboard. The majority of action buttons within the OSP are executed using a left-mouse-button click. Therefore, the term "left-click" is shortened to just "click." Any actions requiring a different method will be explicitly stated.

## Feedback

Any feedback, questions, or concerns about the OSP or the User Guide can be
