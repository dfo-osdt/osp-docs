[Plain Language Summaries](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/communications-community-office/communications-101-boot-camp-canadian-public-servants/plain-language-accessibility-inclusive-communications.html) are required for all scientific publications to improve accessibility. 

The plain language summary of your manuscript should be written for an 8th-grade reading level to ensure broader
comprehension.

##### Generate a Plain Language Summary Draft

You can generate a draft Plain Language Summary (PLS) based on your uploaded manuscript. This tool operates locally within the DFO network, ensuring that any information sent to it **does not leave the DFO intranet**.

The tool utilizes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM) called [Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com/), developed by Meta. Llama 3.2 is specifically designed for use in a closed network environment and therefore **cannot transmit any information to Meta or outside the DFO intranet**.

When using AI tools within a Government of Canada network, it is recommended that you review the [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html) on the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence Language Models.

The **Generate PLS** feature helps create a draft based on your uploaded manuscript. You can generate a PLS multiple times to refine your draft.
