# ORCID

[ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)](https://orcid.org/) is a unique, persistent digital identifier (PID) that distinguishes individual researchers and their work. It connects contributions—such as articles, datasets, and reviews—across organizations, journals, and funding bodies. ORCID ensures researchers receive proper attribution and recognition for their work, even as they change institutions or roles.

ORCID simplifies data collection and reporting, enhances collaboration and visibility across projects, and improves the management of researcher profiles. This supports transparency and continuity in scientific endeavors.

## Authorize Access

![Authorize](/images/account/orcid_authorize.png)

To optimize your experience with ORCID through the OSP, we recommend authorizing the OSP to update your ORCID profile on your behalf. This authorization confirms your DFO affiliation and allows the OSP to automatically add attributes like affiliations, areas of expertise, and research contributions to your ORCID profile.  

By managing your employment records through the OSP, you enable the appearance of an official DFO source badge on your ORCID profile, providing visible, verified credentials that enhance your professional reputation.

## Manage Employment Records

Linking your DFO employment to your ORCID profile through the OSP increases the credibility of your profile, making it more visible and trusted within the scientific community.

### Add Employment through the OSP

To add an employment record via the OSP:

1. Navigate to the **ORCID Integration** section under **Author Profile** in the OSP.
2. Click the **ADD EMPLOYMENT** button.
3. Complete the *Add a DFO employment to ORCID* form, including:
   - **Organization**: Fisheries and Oceans Canada (pre-filled by default)
   - **Department**: Ecosystems and Oceans Science / Sciences des écosystèmes et des océans
   - **Role/Job Title**: For example, *Biologist / Biologiste*
   - Leave **End Date** blank if you are adding your current role.
4. Click **CREATE** to save the role.

### Hide Non-DFO Sourced Employment

When you create your ORCID account, you may add your current employment, which will be displayed as *Sourced by your ORCID User Account*. However, it is recommended to have all records related to your DFO activities include the DFO Source Badge, in line with [ORCID Best Practices](#best-practices).

![Employment](/images/account/orcid_employment.png)

To hide your self-sourced employment record:

1. Add your current and/or previous employment records by following the steps in [Add Employment through the OSP](#add-employment-through-the-osp).
2. Log in to your ORCID account at [orcid.org](https://orcid.org/signin).
3. Under the *Employment* section, find the employment record labeled **Source: *Your Name***.
4. Click the **Visibility** button in the top-right corner of the record to expand the *Visibility Settings*.
    - Visibility options include **Everyone**, **Trusted parties**, or **Only me**, depending on the setting chosen during account creation.
5. Select **Only me** to hide the employment record.

### Edit Employment Records

To edit an employment record:

1. Navigate to the **ORCID Integration** section under **Author Profile** in the OSP.
2. Click the employment record you wish to edit.
3. Modify the details in the **Edit your DFO employment ORCID record** form.
4. Click **SAVE** to apply your changes or **CANCEL** to discard them.

### Delete Employment Records

To delete an employment record:

1. Navigate to the **ORCID Integration** section under **Author Profile** in the OSP.
2. Click the employment record you wish to delete.
3. Click the **DELETE** button **>** Confirm by clicking **DELETE** again.

::: warning
Deleting the employment record will remove it from both the OSP and your ORCID profile!
:::

## Disconnect Your ORCID

To disconnect your ORCID profile from your OSP account:

1. Navigate to the **ORCID Integration** section under **Author Profile** in the OSP.
2. Click the **DISCONNECT YOUR ORCID ID** button.
3. Confirm by clicking **YES**.

Once disconnected, the OSP will delete all keys and tokens used to modify your ORCID profile, preventing further updates by the OSP. However, any modifications previously made by the OSP will remain on your ORCID profile.  

To remove or edit these changes, log in to your account on the [ORCID website](https://orcid.org/).

If you wish to reconnect your ORCID profile to your OSP account, follow the steps in [Add an Existing ORCID to Your OSP
Profile](#add-an-existing-orcid-to-your-osp-profile).

## Best Practices

Below are the recommended best practices for using ORCID within the context of the OSP.

### Authenticate Your ORCID

Authenticating your ORCID account allows the OSP to update your ORCID profile with information from an official DFO source. Follow the steps in [Add an Existing ORCID to Your OSP Profile](#add-an-existing-orcid-to-your-osp-profile) to authenticate your account. If you do not have an ORCID account, you can create one through the OSP by following [Create an ORCID](#create-an-orcid).

![Authenticated ORCID Example](/images/account/orcid_authorized_example.png)

### Use the Official DFO Source Badge

Employment records added through the ORCID website will be sourced by you, whereas those added through the OSP will display an official DFO Source badge. Re-add any DFO-related records through the OSP to apply this badge.

Refer to the example in [Hide Non-DFO Sourced Employment](#hide-non-dfo-sourced-employment) for a visual comparison of source badges.

### Bilingual Organization and Role Title

- Include both English and French versions of your Organization and Role Title.
- Choose the order of languages (English/French or French/English) based on your preference.
- Separate the languages with a `/`.
    - Example: **English / French** or **French / English**

![Employment Entry Example](/images/account/orcid_role_title.png)

### Update Employment Records When Your Employment Changes

Keep your ORCID employment records up-to-date, especially when your role at DFO ends (including Acting roles). Be sure to add an **End Date** to these records via the OSP. This ensures your employment history remains clear, professional, and accurate.
