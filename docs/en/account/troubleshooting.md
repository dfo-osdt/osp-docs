## Common Issues

### Account Registration or Updating

#### Application does not accept my desired password during account creation or password change

- Verify that the password is entered identically in both the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields.  
- Ensure your password meets the following criteria:
  - **Minimum length**: 12 characters.
  - **Security**: It must not appear in the list of known compromised passwords.

#### I do not know the email associated with my account

Contact the [Open Science Support Team](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) for assistance.

#### I did not receive an email to verify my account, or the activation link has expired

Contact the [Open Science Support Team](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) to request a new verification email.

### MRF Form

#### My abstract/summary/explanation lost its formatting when pasted into a text box

- Ensure the text is copied from a document editing program such as **Microsoft Word**, **Google Docs**, or **LibreOffice**.
- Avoid copying text from a PDF document, as formatting may not be preserved during the process.
