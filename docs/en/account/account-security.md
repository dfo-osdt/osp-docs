## 7.2 - Authentication History

The Open Science Portal keeps a history of login attempts for each user's
account. The Authentication History visualizes these login attempts to allow you
to ensure that bad actors are not trying to access your account.

::: danger
If there are multiple login attempts occurring in a very short time span or
other suspicious-looking activities, please change your Open Science Portal
account password and notify the [Open Science Portal Support
Team](mailto:DFO.OpenScience-ScienceOuverte.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).
